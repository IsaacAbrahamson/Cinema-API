## About the Author

My name is Isaac, and I'm a professional frontend web developer. I've been building websites since 2015, and I built this application specifically because I wanted to create a full-stack polished React application using TypeScript. I've built quite a few other interesting projects, and I would love for you to visit [my portfolio website](https://iabrahamson.com) and get in touch.
